## Start bot

ðŸš§ Currently the bot is under construction. ðŸš§<br />
When you commit your code to Github, a Github workflow gets activated. The workflow builds a docker image out of your code, scans this image with snyk and finally pushes the image to docker hub. After that, you can start your container with the following command: (Fill in your credential at the respective "<>" position) 

```
docker run --name kbkm-bot -e botToken=<> -e guildId=<> -e hetznerToken=<> -e duckdnsToken=<> -d tobdocker/kbkm-bot:<version>
```
